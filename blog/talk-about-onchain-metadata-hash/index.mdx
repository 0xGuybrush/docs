# We Need to Talk About the On-Chain Metadata Hash

## Introduction

Solidity compiler has a feature, not known by everyone, that appends the IPFS hash of the [contract metadata](/docs/metadata/) to the contract bytecode. This hash effectively acts as a _fingerprint_ of the compilation, and when deployed, goes onchain. With that, we can verify the contracts ["perfectly"](/docs/full-vs-partial-match/) and fetch the contract source code from IPFS. One of our
missions at Sourcify is to make this feature more known and used, but [not everyone is a fan of it](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1571).

Yes, it is sometimes painful to verify contracts because of the indeterminism caused by the metadata hash. But I will argue this is a useful and at times a necessary feature for correctly verifying contracts. Plus, as long as the tooling is there (we are getting there), you will not have to worry about it most of the times.

Finally, I will call for an open discussion on the metadata hash. I'd really like to see counter-arguments and hopefully we can come up with a better solution. I think other languages should also consider this feature, and if we can agree this is a useful feature, we should come up with a standard for it.

(If you don't fully understand the metadata hash check out [our playground](https://playground.sourcify.dev/) to see it in action.)

## Runtime code vs Creation code

In [source-code verification](http://localhost:3000/blog/verify-contracts-perfectly/) you compare a bytecode to a high-level code (Solidity, Vyper).

When you compile a contract you get two bytecodes:

**Runtime bytecode** is the code of the contract living on the blockchain. This is what really gets executed when you call a contract. You'll find it if you look at the bytecode of an [unverified contract in a block explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x6375394335f34848b850114b66a49d6f47f2cda8#code) or when you call [`eth_getCode(address)`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getcode) on the contract.

**Creation bytecode** is the code that will be executed by the EVM when the contract is being deployed, which will store the runtime code at contract's address.

Since the terms are not well defined, some terminology:

- "code" = "bytecode" in this context. Sometimes people just call it "runtime code", or "creation code".
- "Init code" = "Creation bytecode". This is usually used in [`create2` context](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014).
- "Deployed Bytecode" = "Runtime Bytecode". This is another common way to refer to the runtime bytecode by the Solidity compiler and frameworks. I refrain from using this as sometimes the contract is not deployed and "runtime code" is more accurate.
- `evm.bytecode` = "Creation bytecode". The [Solidity compiler](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html) refers to it as this in the output.
- `evm.deployedBytecode` = "Runtime bytecode". Same as above.

### Which bytecode?

Let's go back to the source code verification. The problem we are trying to solve is we have a contract, and we want to see the _original_ source code of it. Because we humans, can't really read bytecodes.

However, a contract has two bytecodes, which one should we compare the source code to?

### Verifying with Creation Bytecode

One can say that the bytecode counterparty of a contract written in a high level language is the creation bytecode. Because, in a typical contract deployment this is what you _give_ to the EVM to execute.

The problem with the creation bytecode is that it's not always stored onchain. The only time you see this is when you deploy a contract from an Externally Owned Account (EOA) by putting the creation bytecode in the `tx.data` and setting the receiver `tx.to` to `null`. In that case you'll see the creation bytecode if you look at the transaction.

However, for contracts created by other contracts (e.g. factories) it is executed once and then discarded. So someone needs to index and save the creation bytecodes somewhere and you need to trust them. Whereas the runtime bytecode is stored onchain and you can request it from your node with `eth_getCode`.

On the other hand, the creation bytecode of a contract is not necessarily what the compiler outputs. The creation bytecode can be any code that will execute and store the runtime bytecode at the contract address. See [@ricmoo's CREATE2 example](https://devpost.com/software/will-o-the-wisp). He demonstrates how to deploy and `SELFDESTRUCT` a contract, and finally deploy a completely different contract at the same address, even though CREATE2 addreses depend on the init code. In this case the init code is the same but it dynamically gets and writes the contract code from somewhere else. If you change the code where it's dynamically fetched from, you deploy a different contract at the same address. So for this contract, even if we knew its original source code, we can't compile and compare against its creation code.

### Verifying with the Runtime Bytecode

The runtime bytecode is the actual code of the contract and is readily available at `eth_getCode`. The compiler also outputs the runtime bytecode so one can verify contracts with the runtime bytecode too. With that, you can easily verify a contract on the "edge" (i.e. on your machine) trustlessly by getting the bytecode from your execution client.

The compiler output can be different than the onchain one as during deployment the runtime bytecode can be modified by writing the immutable values and the linked libraries in the placeholders. It's ok because, for Solidity, the compiler outputs the `immutableReferences` and libraries have a `__$` placeholder, so we know where these are positioned in the bytecode.

The problem is, not everything in high-level contract code is represented in the runtime bytecode. Imagine this contract excerpt:

```solidity
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        emit OwnerSet(address(0), owner);
    }
```

I can deploy this contract but verify it with a slightly different contract with the following constructor, which can have huge implications:

```solidity
    constructor() {
        owner = tx.origin;
        emit OwnerSet(address(0), owner);
    }
```

This is because this constructor code part will not be included in the runtime bytecode, and the `owner` value is not stored inside the bytecode but in the contract's storage.

### Verifying with the Runtime Bytecode + Metadata Hash

There's a way around this problem. If you verify a contract with its [metadata hash appended](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/metadata.html#encoding-of-the-metadata-hash-in-the-bytecode) to the runtime bytecode, you'll get a [full match](http://localhost:3000/docs/full-vs-partial-match/). This means the source code you are looking at is exactly the same as the one that was originally compiled, because if you change anything about the contract (even a whitespace), the metadata hash will change and you will not get a "full match" but a "partial match".

This, I'd argue, is the only foolproof way to verify a contract's source code. This method covers all the cases above and the ones I haven't mentioned or we don't know about yet. By being based on the runtime code, this also removes the need to trust a third party to index the creation bytecode, and instead you can get the bytecode from your own execution client.

Yes, the indeterminism caused by the metadata hash makes it harder to fully verify contracts. But if we can get the tooling right, we can verify contracts at the deployment pipeline (i.e. right at the point when they are deployed) without causing any changes to the metadata hashes. This also means we need to stop flattening contracts and, if not via metadata, verify with the standard JSON output of the contract.

I believe this needs to be the default way to verify contracts, and only when you can't do it, you should fall back to the partial match.

## Conclusion

The two bytecodes associated with a contract are not always sufficient to correctly verify a contract. The only foolproof way to do it is to use the runtime bytecode with the metadata hash appended to it. Although at Sourcify we base our verification on this, most of the ecosystem don't make this distinction or are just aware of it.

As an outcome of this article I'd really want to see:

1. Other cases where a runtime bytecode or creation bytecode fails to correctly verify a contract.
2. Counter-arguments to the usefulness of the metadata hash.
3. Languages other than Solidity adopting this feature, and coming up with a standard for it.

Do have anything to add for these points above? Please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kuzdogan) or add your remarks in the discussion issue for this article (I'll link). I'll also be updating this article with the feedback I get, and be linking to discussions. This will be a living document.
