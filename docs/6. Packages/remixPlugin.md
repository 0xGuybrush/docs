## Contribution

Development requires interaction with [Remix plugins directory](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-plugins-directory).

When publishing a new version of the plugin:
 - build and test (`npm run build` and `npm run serve`)
 - publish to IPFS (target the dist folder with this [script](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-plugins-directory/blob/master/tools/ipfs-upload/bin/upload-remix-plugin))

 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum/remix-plugins-directory
  cd remix-plugins-directory/tools
  npm i
  node ipfs-upload/bin/upload-remix-plugin <path to dist folder>
 ```

 - load plugin locally, using the generated IPFS Url
    1. Click on the plugin icon
    2. Click on add local plugin
    3. Specify plugin URL. In this case our IPFS URL, for example: `ipfs://xxxxx`
    4. And Voila ðŸŽ‰
 - Make a PR changing the IPFS URL (and possibly other properties) in the plugin [profile](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-plugins-directory/blob/master/plugins/source-verifier/profile.json)
