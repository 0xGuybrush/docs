# Requesting Chain Support

Do you want to verify contracts on an EVM chain? Great! We don't want to be the single source of truth and encourage you to run your own Sourcify instance.

If you still want to request an EVM chain to be supported by Sourcify, please open a pull request with the instructions below for a speedy process:

1. Make sure the new chain is listed in [chains.json](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/src/chains.json) but **this file should not be edited**. It is kept in sync with [chainid.network](https://chainid.network/chains.json) (github: [ethereum-lists/chains](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains)) periodically. If your chain is not included, please first add your chains to the [ethereum-lists/chains](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/chains) repository first. The RPC node [should be an archive node](/docs/immutables).

1. Fork the repository. Branch out from the _staging_ branch with name `add-chain-{chainId}` (e.g. for Ethereum Mainnet `add-chain-1`). This branch name format is required for automated testing. For each chain please open a new PR for the tests to run (no multiple chains e.g. ~~`add-chain-1234-1235`~~)

1. Add the chain details in [sourcify-chains.ts](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/src/sourcify-chains.ts) similar to other chains with `supported: true` and `monitored: false`. If your chain uses an Etherscan or Blockscout fork, use the same regex for other chains with the same block explorer. This field is used for verification with [immutables](/docs/immutables) via the creation bytecode.

1. Install and build the project with `npx lerna bootstrap` and `npx lerna run build`.

1. Provide test contracts:

   1. Deploy one contract with [immutables](/docs/immutables) and one normal contract. This enables displaying if it is possible to verify contracts with immutables on this chain in the [supported chains table](/docs/chains). There are several options:
      1. Using the provided script: You can easily deploy both contracts with an account private key using [`test/chains/deployContracts.js`](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/test/chains/deployContracts.js). See `node deployContracts.js --help`.
      1. Sending a raw transaction with a web wallet:
         1. You can send a raw tx with the contract's creation code using https://www.myetherwallet.com/wallet/deploy and choose your wallet. Paste the bytecode and abi found in [`test/chains/sources/shared/1_Storage.json`](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/test/chains/sources/shared/1_Storage.json) and send the transaction with your wallet.
         1. For the immutables contract paste the bytecode and abi in [`test/chains/sources/shared/WithImmutables.json`](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/test/chains/sources/shared/WithImmutables.json) and set a constructor argument value. Take note of the value as you'll need it in the next steps.
      1. Using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org):
         1. Copy-paste the contract [`test/chains/sources/shared/1_Storage.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/test/chains/sources/shared/1_Storage.sol). Use the compiler settings defined in the metadata: compiler version `0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7` and optimizer disabled on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), you should have exactly the same metadata file. You can check by pasting and decoding the bytecode `60a0604...` at [playground.sourcify.dev](https://playground.sourcify.dev) that it matches to `ipfs://QmSffyjwZxAWUYaAiE25YPpKYyBegQKCBnnBK3tknDSgJ5`. Take note of the contract address.
         1. Copy-paste the contract [`test/chains/sources/shared/WithImmutables.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/blob/staging/test/chains/sources/shared/WithImmutables.sol). If you use the compiler settings defined in the metadata: compiler version `0.7.4+commit.3f05b770` and optimizer disabled on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), you should have exactly the same metadata file. You can check by pasting and decoding the bytecode `60a0604...` at [playground.sourcify.dev](https://playground.sourcify.dev) that it matches to `ipfs://QmPNMaNYjzjA9oHrNdeACBNaDVpdbrbY73QJjB35AD8PHv`. Take note of the contsructor argument and the contract address.
   2. If you are not able to deploy new test contracts above (e.g. because it costs on a mainnet) you can provide existing contracts. Create a folder `test/chains/sources/{chainId}` and store the contract source files and metadata of already deployed contracts there.

1. Add the test for the new chain in `test/chain/chain-tests.js` similar to other chains. Use the functions `verifyContract` or `verifyContractWithImmutables`. If you used the script `deployContracts.js` the contract and the metadata are the following:

   - Storage.sol: `shared/1_Storage.sol` and `shared/1_Storage.metadata.json`
   - withImmutables.sol: `shared/WithImmutables.sol` and `shared/withImmutables.metadata.json`

1. To test locally run `NEW_CHAIN_ID={chainId} npx mocha test/chains/chain-tests.js --exit`

1. Open a pull request targeting the Sourcify **staging** branch. Here's an [example pull request](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/pull/833/files) for reference.

If the tests pass, the chain will be added quickly. The chain will be added to production (master branch) with the next release, which usually happens in 1-2 weeks.
