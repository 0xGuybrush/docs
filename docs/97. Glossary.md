# Glossary

Since Ethereum, EVM, and Solidity is full of not really well defined terms, we try to clear the ones we use here:

### creation bytecode
The bytecode run by the EVM to deploy the smart contract. This will be wrap the *deployed bytecode* with prefixed instructions to deploy the contract, as well as suffixed constructor arguments in [ABI encoding](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/abi-spec.html#abi).


### deployed bytecode 
The bytecode of a smart contract that will be deployed on-chain i.e. the value you'd get when calling [eth_getcode](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/eth_getCode) on the contract. Note that with the contracts with [immutables](/docs/immutables), the deployed bytecode after recompilation will be different than the actually deployed contract.
