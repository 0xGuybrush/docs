# Sourcify Docs

Sourcify is a Solidity source code and [metadata](/docs/metadata) verification tool and repository and acts as a **base layer** allowing other tools build on top of it. We aim to keep as much as smart contract metadata and verified source code open and available via IPFS, and facilitate an improved smart contract UX with verified sources and decoded transactions.

Two types of contract matches (verifications) are defined: **full (perfect) match** for a byte-by-byte match of the original contract source code to the bytecode, and a **partial match** for a _functionally equivalent_ contract source code to the bytecode. Learn more about how Sourcify matches contracts [here](/docs/full-vs-partial-match).

Sourcify has 4 main components:

- **UI** at https://sourcify.dev.
- **Decentralized contract repository** of verified contracts on [IPFS](/docs/repository#ipfs), also directly accessible [on web](/docs/repository#web).
- **Verification [API](/docs/api)** for [supported chains](/docs/chains).
- **Monitoring service** for [supported chains](/docs/chains) to automatically verify deployed contracts with source code published on IPFS.

In addition there are the [Remix Plugin](/docs/packages/remix_plugin),and the [metadata playground](https://playground.sourcify.dev).

## Questions

Make sure you check the [F.A.Q.](/docs/faq) and use the search bar in the docs. You can also reach out to us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/source-verify) or [Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_source-verify:gitter.im)

_Please note once a contract is verified, is not possible to delete it from the repository._
