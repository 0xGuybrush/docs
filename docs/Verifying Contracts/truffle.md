# Truffle Verification

Truffle stores the contract compilation outputs to `build/contracts/` folder. The `.json` file contains the metadata of the contract. You don't need to extract the metadata manually.

Simply drag and drop the output `.json` file of the contract you want to verify to the [sourcify.dev](https://sourcify.dev) UI.
