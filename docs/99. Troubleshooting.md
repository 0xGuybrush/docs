# Build errors

If you receive errors that a module does not have some types or members exported during build, similar to one below:

```
src/ValidationService.ts(3,21): error TS2305: Module '"../../../node_modules/@ethereum-sourcify/core/build"' has no exported member 'SourceMap'.
src/ValidationService.ts(3,32): error TS2305: Module '"../../../node_modules/@ethereum-sourcify/core/build"' has no exported member 'PathBuffer'.
src/ValidationService.ts(3,44): error TS2305: Module '"../../../node_modules/@ethereum-sourcify/core/build"' has no exported member 'PathContent'.
src/ValidationService.ts(3,57): error TS2305: Module '"../../../node_modules/@ethereum-sourcify/core/build"' has no exported member 'CheckedContract'.
```

It is likely the symlinks between packages are broken. npm is trying to download and run the packages as external packages. Symlink the packages with lerna using:
```
npx lerna bootstrap
```

## Error "o.filter is not a function" or "invalid chainIds"

This happens when you add a new chain or move to a new branch with a new chain, but the build files don't contain the newly added chain. You should
```
npx lerna bootsrap
npx lerna run build
```

to create the build files with the added chains.

## Reinstalling dependencies

Switching branches, broken package links etc. may cause errors. In such cases you can try removing and installing the dependencies with:
```
rm -rf  node_modules/ services/core/node_modules/ services/verification/node_modules/ services/validation/node_modules/
npx lerna bootstrap
npx lerna run build
```
