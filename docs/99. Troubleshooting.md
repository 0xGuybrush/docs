# Troubleshooting

## Error "o.filter is not a function" or "invalid chainIds"

This happens when you add a new chain or move to a new branch with a new chain, but the build files don't contain the newly added chain. You should

```
npm install
npx lerna run build
```

to create the build files with the added chains.

## Reinstalling dependencies

Switching branches, broken package links etc. may cause errors. In such cases you can try removing and installing the dependencies with:

```
npm run build:clean
```
