# Frequently Asked Questions

### I want to have another EVM chain supported by Sourcify

Please follow the insturcions in the [chain support](/docs/chain-support) page.

### What are "full match" and "partial match"es?

- **Full Match**: A full match is when the both the bytecode and the metadata hash of the contract at a given address matches the provided source files and the metadata file. This means the given source files are exactly the same as the ones that are compiled and deployed.

- **Partial Match**: A partial match indicates that the deployed and the recompiled bytecodes match excluding the metadata hashes. This means the functionality of the given source files is the same with the contract deployed (similar to Etherscan) but the provided source files can contain differences in variable names, comments, spaces etc.
