:::note
v2 API is only meant for the sourcify.dev UI. Because it makes use of session cookies and [it is not possible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSNotSupportingCredentials) have `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `credentials: true`, meaning these endpoints can only be used on explicitly set domains on the browser. (e.g. sourcify.dev). Please use the v1 verification API if you want Sourcify on your frontend.
